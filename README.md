# Delio DevSecOps Senior Engineer Test

Delio Engineering has decided to start selling "Delio" branded hoodies and coasters. We have developed an API back-end written in Node JS and started building the infrastructure in Terraform. Before the code is deployed the Head of TechOps has asked you to conduct a security audit of the current codebase.
## The task

It's your job to review the security of the new site. To complete this task, you'll need to:

* Create a high-level infrastructure architecture diagram showing a secure way to host the API and frontend in either AWS or Azure.
* Document any security vulnerabilities you find. Detail any findings and categorise them by severity 
* Create an action plan which details how you will remediate each issue
* Implement tooling to identify and resolve vulnerabilities automatically
* Show a clean commit history and an understanding of Git.

Optional extras:

* Add security tests for the code
* Create a security pipeline.

## The rest

Please do not hesitate to get in touch with any questions you have during the process.

Nice
